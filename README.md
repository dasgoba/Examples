Program 1: Automatic query based genome download for a particular organism from NCBI using API and FTP

Rationale: For large scale genome analysis, it is often required to download a number of genome sequences with its annotation from NCBI database. Manual download is laburious, and need continious intervention from the user. This scipt will solve this problem and automatically download genome sequences and annotation by using only query as input.

Usage: python genome_dwnld.py

Required packages: Biopython, FTPLib, eutils, numpy, pybedtools etc.
